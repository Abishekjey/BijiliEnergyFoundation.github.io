<p>Bijili Energy Foundation is a nonprofit organization which has come up with a product that uses Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) technology to light up millions of houses and improve the living quality for millions worldwide in rural areas. Our goal is to give places without electricity an eco-friendly power source. This electricity can help them power multiple devices at a low cost. By reaching out to these areas, Bijili can help millions of people while making a positive impact on the environment.</p>

<a id="solution" class="anchor" href="#solution" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Solution</h3>

<p>Our team’s solution is to develop a microbial fuel cell (MFC) that is capable of charging batteries that could power basic appliances by using organic waste to produce electricity. Specifically, our team plans to build an MFC generator for each village in India, which would be composed of multiple MFCs in one generator, producing enough power to charge several batteries at a time.</p>

<a id="mfc" class="anchor" href="#mfc" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MFC?</h3>

<p>The MFC utilizes bacteria that convert chemical energy into electrical energy through continuous metabolic processes. An MFC is separated into two compartments: anaerobic and aerobic. The anaerobic half contains bacteria that produce protons and electrons as products of their respiration, creating a negatively charged anode. The aerobic half has a positively charged cathode, as well as oxygen circulating through the compartment, combining the protons and energy depleted electrons to create water after the process is complete. The chambers are separated by a semipermeable membrane to keep oxygen out of the anaerobic chamber while still allowing hydrogen ions (H+) to pass through. In the anaerobic chamber, organic waste for the bacteria is circulated. The bacteria metabolize food by first breaking apart the food molecules into hydrogen ions, carbon dioxide, and electrons. Protons pass through the semipermeable membrane by attaching to mediators, chemicals that transfer electrons from the bacteria in the cell to the anode. The resultant difference in charge between the cathode and the anode is what allows for the generation of energy.</p>
